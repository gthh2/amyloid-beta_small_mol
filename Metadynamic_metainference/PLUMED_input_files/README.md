These are the PLUMED input files used to produce the simulations as reported in 'Small molecule sequestration of amyloid-$\beta$ as a drug discovery strategy for Alzheimer's disease' (bioRxiv, 2019). https://doi.org/10.1101/729392

In this paper, we perform metadynamic metainference simulations to characterise the interactions of a small, drug-like molecule, 10074-G5,  and the monomeric form of 42-residue amyloid-$\beta$ peptide (AB42), whose aggregation is associated with Alzheimer's disease.

There are two subdirectories containing relevant input files to rerun the simulations for the apo and holo systems. 

These files include:
Forcefield parameters
NMR data used as restraints
PLUMED input files
Topology files
Reference PDB files for the peptide and the small molecule
